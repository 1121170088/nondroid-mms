============

This project contains the 
MMS \([Multimedia Messaging Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service)\)
PDU \([Protocol Data Unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_data_unit)\) 
decoding classes from the Apache 2-licensed Google's Android Git repository.

I removed dependencies to Android-specific infrastructure, and a few classes I
didn't need, which had too extensive dependencies to clean up quickly.
